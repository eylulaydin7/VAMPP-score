# VAMPP-score
(_Variant Analysis with Multiple Pathogenicity Predictors_)

# Description
VAMPP-score is a metascore for missense variant pathogenicity prediction. It utilizes 52 availaible in silico pathogenicity predictors (ISPPs) available in dbNSFP(v4.7A) based on their performance of distinguishing and identifying three main variant groups (Pathogenic, Benign, and Unknown), trained with ClinVar data.

# Usage
VAMPP-score is not available for installation yet (will made available as a Docker image), however you can access the scripts and data for the manual calculation.

## Data Access



## Web Interface
VAMPP-score is available at [vamppscore.com ](https://vamppscore.com/) with all of its components, with a dynamic interface. You can access the VAMPP-score of a variant, a gene-score for each ISPP based on their prediction performance, and the best-performing ISPPs with their scores for your variant/gene of interest.


## Update status
VAMPP-score is getting updated monthly and recalculated with the inclusion of new missense variants in ClinVar, made available on the web-platform.
